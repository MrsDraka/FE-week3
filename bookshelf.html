                                Nonagenarian Jacob Jankowski reflects back on his wild and wondrous days with a circus.
                                It's the Depression Era and Jacob, finding himself parentless and penniless, joins the
                                Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. There he meets the freaks, grifters,
                                and misfits that populate this world. Jacob introduces us to Marlena, beautiful star of
                                the equestrian act; to August, her charismatic but twisted husband (and the circus'
                                animal trainer); and to Rosie, a seemingly untrainable elephant.

                                Beautifully written, with a luminous sense of time and place, Water for Elephants tells
                                of love in a world in which love's a luxury few can afford.</p>

                                French Elle, the father of two young childen, a 44-year-old man known and loved for his
                                wit, his style, and his impassioned approach to life. By the end of the year he was also
                                the victim of a rare kind of stroke to the brainstem. After 20 days in a coma, Bauby
                                awoke into a body which had all but stopped working: only his left eye functioned,
                                allowing him to see and, by blinking it, to make clear that his mind was unimpaired.
                                Almost miraculously, he was soon able to express himself in the richest detail:
                                dictating a word at a time, blinking to select each letter as the alphabet was recited
                                to him slowly, over and over again. In the same way, he was able eventually to compose
                                this extraordinary book.
